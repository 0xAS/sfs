Changes in the Sound Field Synthesis-Toolbox. Recent changes on top.

0.3.0

    - added the possibility to calculate the wave field for a arbritrary
      positioned plane in 3D
    - added 3D WFS functions
    - make the Toolbox work in 3D, which brakes backwards compability!
    - changed direction of focused source from the conf.xref vector directly
      into xs. For a focused source xs is now [1x6]

0.2.3 (9 April 2013)

    - summed up line, point, ... sources to green_function for mono and imp
    - introduced global wave_field functions for mono and imp
    - fixed binaural simulations for NFCHOA
    - removed compatibility for octave versions <3.6
    - fixed a critical bug for the HRTF farfield extrapolation, due to the new
      secondary source selection behavior

0.2.2 (27 November 2012)

    - added functions to calculate the sound pressure for monochromatic WFS at a
      single point in analogy to the point_source function
    - changed the behavior of secondary_source_selection to returning a new x0
      vector
    - added compatibility for octave 3.6
    - first fix of secondary source selection for focused sources (now they
      point always in the direction of the reference point) 

0.2.1 (15 June 2012)
    
    - added NFCHOA 2.5D monochromatic
    - added NFCHOA 2.5D binaural simulations
    - added SDM 2.5D monochromatic
    - make NFCHOA work under Octave
    - fixed direction of plane waves and point sources for NFCHOA time domain
      simulations
    - changed syntax for wave_field_* and driving_* functions:
        xs,f,src => xs,src,f
        xs,L,src => xs,src,L
        xs,L,f,src => xs,src,f,L

0.2.0 (25 April 2012)

    - first public release (under the GPLv3+ license)
