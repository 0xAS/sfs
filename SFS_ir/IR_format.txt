# Documentation for the format HRIR and BRIR have to be stored to be useable
# with SFS

FIXME: The following link has to be changed if we make a public release of our HRIR data set and wanted to put the documentation for the format to the public part of the Wiki!
For a detailed description of the format with some nice sketches have a look at:
https://dev.qu.tu-berlin.de/projects/capture/wiki/IRs_file_format

NOTE: in the long term we will use OpenDAFF (http://www.opendaff.org/),
but at the moment it is not finished. Therefore I propose a simple Matlab
struct format to use.

To produce a desired IR file, you should have a look at the create_irs_mat.m file
and add your own IR data set to it.

The IR should be stored as a struct in a mat file containing the following
properties:

|     Name            |      Description                                                     |            Dimension         |   Unit|
