# Documentation for the format HRIR and BRIR have to be stored to be useable
# with SFS

NOTE: in the long term we will use OpenDAFF (http://www.opendaff.org/),
but at the moment it is not finished. Therefore I propose a simple Matlab
struct format to use.

To produce a desired IR file, you should have a look at the create_irs_mat.m file
and add your own IR data set to it.

The IR should be stored as a struct in a mat file containing the following
properties:

       Name    |      Description        |           Dimension          | Unit
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
.left          | left signals of IR set  | length of IR x number of IRs |
.right         | right sign. of IR set   | length of IR x number of IRs |
.angle         | [azimuth; elevation]    | 2 x number of IRs            | rad
.azimuth       | azimuth angle           | 1 x number of IRs            | rad
.elevation     | elevation angle         | 1 x number of IRs            | rad
.distance      | measurement distance    | 1 x 1                        | m
.direction     | direction to the source | 1 x 1                        | rad
.fs            | sampling rate           | 1 x 1                        | Hz
.tag           | HRIR or BRIR            | string                       |
.description   | description for IR set  | string                       |
